		<p><i>This article is about the company.</i></p>
		<h2>From the garage to the Googleplex</h2>
		<p>The Google story begins in 1995 at <b>Stanford University.</b> <br> 
<b><i>Larry Page</i></b> was considering Stanford for grad school and <b><i>Sergey Brin</i></b>, a student
there, was assigned to show him around.</p>

		<p>By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following
year they struck a <mark>partnership.</mark><br> Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of individual pages on the World Wide Web.</p>

		<p>They called this search engine <cyan><i>Backup</i></cyan>.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<h2>Initial public offering</h2>
		<p>Google's initial public offering (IPO) took place five years later, on 19<sup>th</sup> August 2004.<br>
At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for <s>30</s> <u>20</u>years, until the year 2024.</p>
