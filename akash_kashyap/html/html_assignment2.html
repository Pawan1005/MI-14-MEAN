    <p1>
        The Google story begins in 1995 at <strong>Stanford University.</strong>
        <i> <b> Larry Page </b></i> was considering Stanford for grad school and <i> <b>Sergey Brin </b></i>, a student
        there, was assigned to show him around.
        <br>

    <p>By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following
        year they struck a <mark2> partnership</mark2>.<br>
        Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
        individual pages on the <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"> World Wide Web.</a> <br>

        They called this search engine <i><span style=background-color:blue;>Backrub</span> </i>.
