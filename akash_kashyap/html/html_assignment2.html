    <h2> <b>From the garage to the Googleplex </b></h2>
 <p1 >
    The Google story begins in 1995 at <strong>Stanford University.</strong>
    <i> <b> Larry Page </b></i> was considering Stanford for grad school and  <i> <b>Sergey Brin </b></i>, a student
    there, was assigned to show him around.
    <br>

   <p>By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following
    year they struck a <mark2> partnership</mark2>.<br>
    Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
    individual pages on the <a  href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"> World Wide Web.</a> <br>

    They called this search engine <i><span style=background-color:blue;>Backrub</span> </i>.
