    <h1>Google</h1>
    <p1><i>This article is about the company</i></p1>
    <h2><b>From the garage to the Googleplex </b></h2>
    <p2>The Google story begins in 1995 at <b>Stanford University.</b>
       <br> <i><b>Larry Page</b></i>was considering Stanford for grad school and <i><b>Sergey Brin,</b></i>
    a student <br>there,was assigned to show him around.</p2>
    <br>
    <p3>By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following <br>
    year they struck a <mark>partnership</mark>.
<br>Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of 
<br>individual pages on the <span style= "color:darkmagenta;">World Wide Web.</span>
<br>They called this search engine <i><mark1>Backrub.</mark1></i></p3>

<hr>
<h2><b>Initial public offering</b></h2>

August 2004.

<br> years,until the year 2024.
