    <h2>From the garage to the Googleplex</h2>   
    <p>The Google story begins in 1995 at <b>Stanford University.</b> <br> <b><i>Larry Page</b></i> was
       considering Stanford for grad school and <b><i>Sergey Brin,</i></b> a student there, 
       was assigned to show him around.</p> 
    <p>By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following year they struck a partnership.<br>
        Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of individual pages on the World Wide Web . 
    </p>   
    <p>They called this search engine <i>Backrub.</i> </p>
